# Arsenal TypeScript Project

A **TypeScript-based ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) script** for the Roblox game Arsenal. This project demonstrates how to implement simple visual enhancement such as **Box ESP, Name ESP, Chams, and Distance indicators** using TypeScript instead of Luau.

This project uses [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/) to write code in TypeScript, which is automatically compiled into Luau code. Then, [tape](https://github.com/belkworks/tape) bundles all the necessary code into a single Luau file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the github repository.
2. Use **"pnpm i"** to install dependencies.
3. Build the project using **"pnpm build"**.
4. Project code should be bundled into **"dist.lua"**.
5. Use **"pnpm clear"** if you're having bundling errors.

## Note

Please use this project as a learning resource rather than simply copying and pasting the code.
If you have questions or need guidance, feel free to reach out to me on Discord at "Glenacus"

If you're having problems with **"rojo"**, install [rokit](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit) and run **"rokit init"**, then **"rokit add rojo"**. This should resolve any issues you encounter.
